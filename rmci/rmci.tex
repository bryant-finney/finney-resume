O Developed and integrated shared libraries in C for communication and control of third-party tracker system

o Two communications protocols over RS-485 and RS-232 for configuration transmission and data retrieval

O Protocols included ASCII and non-ASCII binary packets with checksums and ASCII hex representations

o Configuration parameters were retrieved from SQLite Database and ASCII configuration file

O Developed and integrated libraries for tokenizing and parsing ASCII file contents with comments

o Integrated tracker communications, acquisition, and processing libraries with framework for collecting RTB data

O Developed lightweight logging library using variadic functions for creating and 
writing to log files, as well as writing messages to std-out for real-time feedback 
during developmental testing of framework libraries

O Assisted with aircraft installation and testing on the airframes OH-58C and OH-6A of the entire embedded
system in aspects of vibration data collections and rotor track height data collections
O Developed and tested vibration data analysis algorithms for condition-based maintenance from an embedded OS
o Implemented the algorithms in C for utilization by an ARM cortex 335x series microcontroller. The focus of the
algorithms was on time domain, frequency domain, and synchronous domain analyses
o Developed a high-level framework in C incorporated with the Yocto project for handling onboard processing
O Designed and integrated communication functions with an embedded SQLite database for retrieving
algorithm parameters, as well as loading and storing both raw and processed data
O Interfaced with low-level routines for collecting raw data and monitoring system state via a watchdog timer
O Established communications protocol for system-wide integration in order to perform all onboard data
acquisitions and processing upon triggers either by the user or by flight regime
o Performed software verification testing by comparing results from the data analysis framework with a Python
transliteration of the original MatLab scripts. The results were displayed and analyzed
O Designed and tested firmware for the PIC24F08KL301 MCU using MPLAB X, Eclipse, and PICKIT3
o The microcontroller was used to emulate tachometer signals with two 8-bit timers and to translate between RS-
485 and RS-232 message protocols for interfacing with a rotor blade tracking system
o The two UART peripherals were utilized for the serial communications: one dedicated to RS-485 communication
with the controlling OS, and the other was dedicated to RS-232 communication with the tracking system
o Implemented a communications protocol for responding to various control bytes transmitted over RS-485
o Developed a boot loader for executing firmware updates over serial traffic: created host side in Python using
minimal packages for ease of deployment on the embedded Linux system, and tested the MCU side written in C
o Phase 1 development was done on the SAMD21G18A MCU with Eclipse and the Arduino IDE for programming
O Led a multidisciplinary team to design a new product for tracking helicopter rotor blades
o Performed individual research and benchmarking, theoretical modeling using linear algebra and geometry, and
data visualization for demonstrating theoretical system performance characteristics. Provided the
recommendation for the selected design and continued to lead the development of this design
o Conducted electro-optical radiometric modeling of solid state sensors for blade detection
o Completed optical design of system hardware using matrix ray tracing in MathCAD, Python, and Matlabo Developed opto-mechanical design of illuminator and sensor to minimize space requirements while considering
reliability, affordability, and maintainability
o Reviewed materials and manufacturing processes for component design and selection
O Design criteria included the following: overall size, weight, and cost; IR safety compliance according to IEC 60825-1 and IEC 62471; insensitivity to environmental lighting conditions; environmental qualification according to DO-160 and MIL-STD-810; hardware reliability, aesthetic appeal, and convenience of operation to the end user
o The system is currently entering the prototype stage and is estimated to cost less than existing systems while improving performance and reducing maintenance costs
o Performed all engineering analysis, design, and fabrication of a stand for testing developmental systems
o The stand replicated a scaled rotor of approximately 8 ft. diameter, capable of rotational speed over 300 rpm
o Used finite airfoil drag analysis to model the transient and steady-state speed based
on input power. Total cost was under \$1000, and the test stand was used for rotor track and balance tests
